## ‚ö° Quick Actions (Pick One)

### Option A: Deploy to Vercel NOW (Easiest - 5 minutes)

1. Open Terminal and run:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/abhimanyutomar/Documents/learn-clone
   
   # Initialize git if not already done
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   ```

2. Go to [github.com](https://github.com/new) and create a new repository

3. Push your code:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/learn-clone.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

4. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your `learn-clone` repository
   - Click "Deploy"

5. **Done!** Your app will be live at `https://your-project.vercel.app`

6. **Add Domain:**
   - In Vercel: Settings ‚Üí Domains ‚Üí Add your domain
   - Update DNS records as instructed
   - Wait for propagation

---

### Option B: Test Locally with Public URL (Quickest - 2 minutes)

```bash
cd /Users/abhimanyutomar/Documents/learn-clone

# Run the interactive deployment script
./deploy.sh
```

Then select option 4: "Build and expose with ngrok"

**You'll get a public URL like:** `https://abc123.ngrok.io`

Anyone can access your app through this URL immediately!

---

### Option C: Build and Check Locally First

```bash
cd /Users/abhimanyutomar/Documents/learn-clone

# Install dependencies if not already installed
npm install

# Build production version
npm run build

# Test locally
npm install -g serve
serve -s build -l 3000
```

Visit: http://localhost:3000

## üåê For Custom Domain

Once your app is deployed:

### If using Vercel/Netlify:
1. Buy a domain from [Namecheap](https://namecheap.com), [GoDaddy](https://godaddy.com), or [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com)
2. In Vercel/Netlify dashboard: Add custom domain
3. Update DNS records at your domain registrar
4. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation
5. SSL will be automatically configured!

### If self-hosting on VPS:
1. Point your domain's A record to your server IP
2. Follow the nginx configuration in `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`
3. Install SSL certificate with Let's Encrypt (commands provided in guide)
